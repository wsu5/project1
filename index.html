            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Animals have been a difficult object to avoid on road for human drivers. Recognizing and avoiding vehicle collisions with animals have become a greater challenge to autonomous vehicles. Comparing to human being, some animals are smaller in size which are harder to be detected and their behaviors are less predictable than human. According to Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs), every year United States has 725,000 to 1,500,000 cases of vehicle collisions with wild life. And Canada has roadkill rate of 4 to 8 animals per day. By using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to perform image segmentation and recognition, the algorithm can detect commonly found animals. Along side with lane detection and animal behavior predictions, the system has the capability to track animals’ behavior in real time and provide movement predictions. If the animal is within the predicted line, the system responses with ‘STOP’ to alert the vehicle.

            <h2>Picking the Right Sensors</h2>
            <p>
              There are two common types of sensors used on autonomous vehicles to visualize surrounding environments to avoid vehicle collisions with human, animals, and obstacles. From here we compare the pros and cons in terms of performance in various conditions for LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor and camera sensor. 
            </p>
              
            <p>
            <h5>LiDAR</h6>
              Determines ranges by targeting objects or surfaces with multiple laser beams. By measuring the time for the laser to return to the receiver, it can detect all surfaces and objects around the LiDAR. Typical LiDAR with 360 degree point of view has a scanning frequency of 10 Hz which scans the surrounding area 10 times in a second.
            </p>
          
            <p>
            <h5>Camera</h6>
              Camera sensor converts variable attenuation of light waves through lens into small bursts of current that carry the information of an image. The optical characteristics of a camera can be illustrated as below where light waves pass through camera lens at certain focal length to produce an image on the camera sensor.

            <h3>Sensor Comparison</h3>
            <h3>Camera vs LiDAR</h3>
              LiDAR Pros: The significant advantage of LiDAR is that it can provide a 3D output even through shadows, sunlight or headlights from incoming cars which performs better than cameras or even human eyes in these harsh conditions.
              <br>
              LiDAR cons: LiDAR can be sensitive to weather and temperature. The wavelength stability can be affected by temperature and cause a poor Signal-to-Noise ratio which potential can cause a creation of false outcomes.
              <br>
              Camera Pros: With the combination of computer vision and machine learning models, one of the very important things that only camera can do out of all sensors is to read specific text from road signs. Cameras can also be adjustable by simply replace lens to fit different needs. For example fish eye lens can be used for object detection around the vehicle with wider field of view and telephoto lens can be used for narrow long range detection.
              <br>
              Camera Cons: Although cameras are better at imaging, they do not have the direct feature of range detection that LiDAR has. Weather conditions can also be one of the challenges to camera. The picture below shows the camera performance could be reduced with rain or dirt on the lens.
